# Namer

This project is developed during the Google Flutter codelab. It showcases a basic Flutter application that demonstrates the fundamental concepts and features of the framework.

This application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". The user can request the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. Refer to the official Flutter documentation for installation instructions.
